# How To Play QSD

Algorithmic stablecoins can be confusing for the uninitiated so we have prepared this brief guide to show how best to interact with Quantum Set Dollar.

## Bootstrapping
During Bootstrapping the QSD Price Oracle is fixed at 1.10 DAI, the protocol will act as if it is above peg regardless of the price.     
You can earn rewards by bonding QSD or by bonding the QSD/DAI LP Token. The bootstrapping period will last for 72 Epochs or 12 Days.


## Post-Bootstrapping
Post Bootstrapping Quantum Set Dollar will migrate to itâ€™s new updated model and access to QSD Bonding will be locked if TWAP is above $1. 
When the TWAP of QSD is above peg you can Bond your QSD/DAI LP to earn rewards, selling or compounding your rewards will lower the price of QSD dragging it below peg. 
When QSD price is below peg, remove your QSD/DAI LP, buy QSD with your rewards and bond your QSD, this ensures that you will receive rewards when QSD next returns above peg.
Whilst QSD is below peg your bonded QSD will earn QSG rewards at a rate of 0.09QSD per Ethereum block, QSG rewards are available below peg only.

We have created this flow chart to show how this positive feedback loop of selling rewards above peg and buying QSD below peg ensures the self stability of QSD while incentivising participants both above and below the peg of 1 DAI.
