# How To Play QSD

Algorithmic stablecoins can be confusing for the uninitiated so we have prepared this brief guide to show how best to interact with Quantum Set Dollar.

There are 2 options to receive rewards on Quantum Set Dollar:
1. Stage and Bond QSD to receive QSD rewards above $1.02 and QSD rewards below $1.02
2. Stage and Bond QSD:BUSD LP to receive QSD rewards abve $1.02

Note that Access to QSD Bonding will be locked if TWAP is above $1.02. 
When the TWAP of QSD is above peg you can Bond your QSD/BUSD LP to earn rewards, selling or compounding your rewards will lower the price of QSD dragging it below peg. 
When QSD price is below peg, buy QSD with your rewards and bond your QSD, this ensures that you will receive rewards when QSD next returns above peg.
Whilst QSD is below peg your bonded QSD will earn QSG rewards at a rate of 0.09QSD per Ethereum block, QSG rewards are available below peg only.

We have created this flow chart to show how this positive feedback loop of selling rewards above peg and buying QSD below peg ensures the self stability of QSD while incentivising participants both above and below the peg of 1 DAI.
