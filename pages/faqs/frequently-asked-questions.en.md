# QSD Frequently Asked Questions

<br/>

* **How is QSD different from ESD, DSD xSD and other stablecoin forks?**    

Whilst we took our inspiration from ESD, QSD is different in many ways. Here the the highlights:    
4 hour epochs    
No Lock ups other than 1 epoch delay for security    
QSD bonding is during contraction periods only, LPâ€™ng can be done any time          
Separate governance token (QSG) for DAO that can be earned by bonding QSD when below peg. QSG can also be staked to earn further rewards, paid in QSD    
Non-Compounding QSD rewards       
Single asset compounding of LP Rewards     
<br/>

* **How can I earn rewards?**

You can earn QSD rewards by doing one or all of the following:

Providing liquidity to the QSD/DAI uniswap pool [here] and bond resulting LP tokens here [insert hyperlink]
Bond QSD here [insert hyperlink]
Additional QSD can also be earned by staking the governance token QSG here [insert hyperlink] 

<br/>

* **How are rewards split?**

During expansion, LP and QSD bonders are rewarded and a small portion is allocated to the treasury. On a sliding scale, up to 5.4% of supply is split between LP, bonded QSD and treasury (63%,27%,10%)

<br/>

* **Do rewards compound?**

LP rewards can be compounded using the button available on the UI, which will automatically sell half of your rewarded QSD to DAI and add to your LP. During Bootstrapping QSD rewards will compound, however, post bootstrapping QSD rewards will not automatically compound, this is to encourage selling above peg.

<br/>

 * **What does bonded/unbonded mean?**

If your LP tokens or QSD are showing in a bonded state, it means that you are earning rewards as long as the TWAP is >$1. You may unbond at any time but this will stop accruing rewards. When the state is unbonded, you may withdraw your LP, QSD or rewards in the following EPOCH after the one you unbonded in. 

<br/>

* **What is an EPOCH**

An epoch is simply a block of time for the protocol expansion or contraction. Currently this time for QSD is 4 hours. During expansion, rewards are calculated and awarded per epoch. 

<br/>

* **Can I bond QSD while in expansion?**

No, you can only bond QSD below peg while TWAP is below $1.

<br/>


* **Can I add to my bonded QSD below peg?** 

Yes

<br/>

* **What happens to the QSD in treasury?**

Funds in the treasury are controlled by QSG holders and will be used for ongoing development of the protocol. Any changes to the protocol and release of spending funds from the treasury will be voted upon by the DAO. 

<br/>

* **What is QSG (Quantum Set Governance Token)?**

QSG is a valueless governance token for QSD and is the DAO for the protocol. It can only be earned by bonding QSD when the protocol is below peg. Furthermore, earned QSG can be staked to earn more rewards paid in QSD. QSG holders can submit and vote on proposals in DAO. Quorum for passing of proposals is 33%.

<br/>

* **Can I withdraw rewards any time or is there a lock?** 

You can withdraw your rewards 1 epoch after you unbond.  This 1 epoch delay is a security feature. 

<br/>

* **What about coupons?**

QSD does not issue coupons. Rejoice. 

<br/>

* **How do I contribute to the protocol and/or participate in governance?**

When the protocol is below peg, you can bond QSD and earn governance tokens - QSG. QSG holders can vote for proposals. Anyone can participate in community discussions in discord channels.
