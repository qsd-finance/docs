## What is Quantum Set Dollar?

Quantum Set Dollar (QSD) is a decentralized algorithmic stablecoin, designed to self-stabilize to the value of 1 DAI. The stabilization effect is achieved through phases of supply expansion when QSD is valued above 1 DAI and incentives to increase price when QSD is valued below 1 DAI.
The protocol is centred around 2 ERC-20 tokens:

- QSD - The Self-Stabilizing Dollar Token
- QSG - The Governance Token

## Features

Quantum Set Dollar has composed a number of different mechanics from various elastic supply stablecoin projects, as well as some novel approaches to below peg mechanics, into a single protocol. This combination gives it unique features:

* **Selling Pressure Above Peg**

1 Epoch Lock up to encourage selling above peg and avoid rewards bottlenecking    
Single assed DAI/QSD LP Zap function to sell 50% of rewarded QSD to DAI and add to LP    


* **Incentives Below Peg**

QSD Bonding access Below Peg Only    
QSG Farming Below Peg Only
