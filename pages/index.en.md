## What is Quantum Set Dollar?

Quantum Set Dollar is a second generation algorithmic stablecoin on Binance Smart Chain. Based on the original Empty Set Dollar design with an improved model and partially backed by a cashflow generating treasury reserve that operates a buyback and burn strategy below peg.

QSD is designed to be pegged to the value of 1 BUSD. This is achieved through phases of supply expansion when QSD is valued above 1.02 BUSD and supply contraction, performed by the treasury buy back and burn system, when QSD is valued below $0.98. The protocol is centred around 2 BEP-20 tokens:

QSD - Quantum Set Dollar
QSG - Quantum Set Governance
