## What is Quantum Set Dollar?

Quantum Set Dollar (QSD) is a decentralised, experimental stablecoin, using previous stablecoin designs as its foundation. Updated mechanics ensure improved peg stability and the ability to easily iterate provides an experimental edge for innovation limited only by imagination.

QSD is designed to be pegged to the value of 1 DAI. This is achieved through phases of supply expansion when QSD is valued above 1 DAI and incentives to increase price when QSD is valued below 1 DAI. The protocol is centred around 2 ERC-20 tokens:

QSD - Quantum Set Dollar
QSG - Quantum Set Governance


## Features

Quantum Set Dollar has composed a number of different mechanics from various elastic supply stablecoin projects, as well as some novel approaches to below peg mechanics, into a single protocol. This combination gives it unique features:

* **Selling Pressure Above Peg**

1 Epoch Lock up to encourage selling above peg and avoid rewards bottlenecking    
Single asset DAI/QSD LP Zap function to sell 50% of rewarded QSD to DAI and add to LP    


* **Incentives Below Peg**

QSD Bonding access Below Peg Only    
QSG Farming Below Peg Only
